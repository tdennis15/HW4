## CS 460 H4 ASP.NET MVC web page
This project is to create a web application that will have a few navigation pages and a form in which a user provides data and it returns either a table or a list. The complexity needs to be like that of a bank loan pay out table - Amortization table.

To start I went through the basic documentation that MicroSoft had available on [ASP.NET MVC structure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/adding-controller).
